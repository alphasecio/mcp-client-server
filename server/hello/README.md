# Hello MCP Server

A minimal [FastMCP](https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp) server with two sample tools. Ideal for quick experiments and testing with [MCP clients](https://github.com/alphasecio/mcp-client-server/blob/main/client/README.md). Can easily be deployed to serverless platforms like [Railway](https://railway.app/?referralCode=alphasec), [Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run?hl=en), and others.
